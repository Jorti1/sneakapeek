<h2><font color="red"> Do I still need to see my doctor, if I have an ultrasound performed with Sneak A Peek 3D/4D Mobile Ultrasound?</font></h2>
<p>Yes.  All expecting moms must be receiving care/under the care of a physician.  Please note that an elective 3D/4D ultrasound is not intended to take the place of a diagnostic ultrasound, or any other test or treatment that has been or may be recommended by your healthcare provider.  Please note that our technicians cannot interpret, diagnose medical conditions, or offer medical conclusions regarding the images produced.  We Perform 2D/3D/4D elective ultrasounds- for the purpose of viewing baby, gender determination and to provide families with keepsake mementos.  </p>

<h2><font color="blue">How do I prepare for my appointment?</font></h2>
<p>You should be sure to be well hydrated.  We encourage moms to drink plenty of water, in the 5-7 days prior to your ultrasound appointment.  This will help to ensure your amniotic fluid is clear, as well as full.  Also, sound waves travel better through fluid, so a full bladder can enhance the quality of your ultrasound and result in a better picture.</p>

<h2><font color="green">When is the best time to get an ultrasound?</font></h2>
<p>It’s best to perform the ultrasound when your baby is awake and moving around.  If you are not diabetic, or your doctor has not recommended against it, drink something sweet approximately 30 minutes prior to your appointment.

The best time to see your baby, as a whole, is between 16-26 weeks.  At 25-34 weeks, we can see baby’s face in more detail.  Between 28 and 32 weeks is usually the best.  During this time your baby develops more fat and his or her face becomes more defined, making it easier to see his/her face and chubby cheeks.  After 34 weeks, it becomes a little more difficult to obtain better images of baby because he/she has less room to move around.  Your baby’s gender can be determined starting at 16 weeks.</p>

<h2><font color="purple">Can you guarantee a clear picture of my baby?</font></h2>
<p>Although we would love to be able to guarantee a clear picture of your little One, unfortunately we cannot guarantee that we will always get clear pictures.  There are several factors that may influence the quality of your scan.  These factors include:

         -Amount of amniotic fluid (important to be hydrated).

         -Baby’s position (ex: face down toward mom’s spine,

                                      against the placenta, breech).

         -Position of placenta.

         -Position of umbilical cord.

         -Sleeping baby (best time is when baby is awake)

         -Mother’s body type

         -Gestational age</p>

<h2><font color="red">How does an ultrasound work and is it safe for me and my baby?</font></h2>
<p>During your ultrasound, the technician will place the ultrasound probe/transducer firmly against your skin.  The probe then directs small pulses of high-frequency sound waves into your body.  These sound waves reflect off of tissue, bones and organs, and pulses and echoes are sent back to the probe and relayed to the machine.  The machine will then display these echoes on the screen, forming a two dimensional image (2D-black and white picture of baby).  3D scans show still images of your baby in 3 dimensions, while 4D scans show your baby in motion and allows for a more realistic image of your baby.

Ultrasounds have been used for over 35 years and have been deemed safe because they use sound waves, to create an image, instead of radiation (as do x-rays).  To date, there have been no proven side effects from its proper use.</p>

<h2><font color="blue">Can I take pictures during my ultrasound session?</font></h2>
<p>Yes you can!  We understand how exciting this moment is for you and your family.  Click away!</p>

<h2><font color="green">Do I need to make an appointment?</font></h2>
<p>Yes.  We do require appointments, however, we do encourage you to call during the day, as we may have cancellations.</p>

<h2><font color=purple"">What form of payment do you accept?</font></h2>
<p>We accept VISA, MasterCard and cash.  All of our prices include sales tax.</p>

<h2><font color="red">What Communities/cities do you serve?</font></h2>
<p>We serve Stanislaus County, San Joaquin County and the Bay Area, however, we charge an additional $25 travel fee beyond the Altamont Pass (50 miles).</p>
